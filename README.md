# RabbitMQ MSG

Pet project for playing with RabbitMQ in Java and Node.js

Demonstrates communication between Producers and Consumers via with RabbitMQ with AuthProxy and measures its performance.

## Communication Architecture

1. Producers send messages to RabbitMQ using AMQP.
2. RabbitMQ routes them to proper queues (queue per Consumer instance) using _consumerId_ as a _routingKey_.
3. Consumers connect to AuthProxy via WebSockets.
4. AuthProxy gets fed from queues using AMQP and forwards to proper Consumers.

## Features

* Reliability.

  - Durable queue with expiry time (defined with policy in _rabbit_definitions.json_).
    That makes RabbitMQ to wait for a while before dropping queue after Consumer disconnected, giving a chance
    to reconnect and consume messages delivered in the meantime.
  - Possible to make messages from Producer persistent, so they will survive broker restart
    (some performance penalty here).
  - ACKs between RabbitMQ and Producers/AuthProxy.
  - Possible ACKs between AuthProxy and Consumers (ideally synchronized with ACKs between RabbitMQ and AuthProxy).

* Security.

  - AuthProxy validates Consumer access token on incoming connection.
  - AuthProxy drops connection when token expired, Consumer must reconnect (also possible more performant and complex
    solution: refresh without connection dropping).
  - AuthProxy can be the only way to access network, RabbitMQ and Producers not exposed.
  - Possible to use TLS (wss://).


# Running


## Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Maven (verified with 3.3.9)
* npm (verified with 3.10.10)
* node.js (verified with 6.11.1)
* Docker (verified with 1.13.1)
    
## RabbitMQ and AuthProxy

1. Let's install Javascript dependencies needed for AuthProxy:
 
    `cd auth-proxy`
    
    `npm install`
    
    `cd ..`

2. Let's start docker containers, keeping output tailed (_-Ddocker.follow_):
    
    `mvn docker:start -Ddocker.follow`

## Consumers

1. Let's install Javascript dependencies needed for Consumers:

    `cd consumers`
    
    `npm install`
    
2. Let's start 3 Consumers (ids: 101, 102, 103), 2 instances of each (so 6 Consumer instances total):
    
    `node ./consumers.js 101 103 2`

## Producers

1. Let's compile Producers code:
    
    `mvn clean package`
    
2. Let's start 2 Producers (ids: 201, 202), each generating messages for all Consumers (101, 102, 103):
    
    `java -cp target/rabbitmq-msg-0.0.1.jar pl.jojczykp.rabbitmq_msg.Producers 201 202 101 103`

## Expected messages logs

* Each Producer should periodically log fact of sending same message to all Consumers:
    
    ```
    Sending to (consumer101 to consumer103): [producer202.20475 says Hello 1] 
    Sending to (consumer101 to consumer103): [producer201.20548 says Hello 1] 
    Confirming
    Confirming
    OK
    OK
    ```
        
* For each Producer log, AuthProxy should print 6 corresponding forwarding logs (12 total):
    
    ```
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer101.1: Forwarding [producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer103.1: Forwarding [producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer102.2: Forwarding [producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer101.2: Forwarding [producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer103.2: Forwarding [producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer102.1: Forwarding [producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer101.1: Forwarding [producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer103.1: Forwarding [producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer102.2: Forwarding [producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer103.2: Forwarding [producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer101.2: Forwarding [producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    AuthProxy> AuthProxy 1: For consumer.consumer102.1: Forwarding [producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    ```
        
* Each Consumer should log messages received from each Producer:
    
    ```
    Received for (consumer101 to consumer103)*2: 6*[producer201.20902 says Hello 8]
    Received for (consumer101 to consumer103)*2: 6*[producer202.20118 says Hello 8]
    ```
    
        
# Performance

Procedure above sets complete environment that tests can be executed in.
I decided however to avoid using docker since it may affect results significantly.

Instead, I run RabbitMQ in VirtualBox with dedicated memory, CPU cores and IP address.
This is still far from perfect (ideally real network should be used), but should be more reliable
than docker.

## Preparation
    
I have conducted a few simple performance tests to understand capacity of proposed configuration.

* Following configuration was used:
    * Fedora 26 with 8 Cores i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz
    * 1 RabbitMQ instance (no clustering) in 4-CPU, 16GB RAM VirtualBox
    * 1 AuthProxy
    * 1 Producer
    * 40000 Consumers, 1 instance of each
    
* To run tests against VirtualBox rather than docker a few code changes were required:
    * Commenting out _sleep()_ in Producers, so that they can produce messages as fast as RabbitMQ can consume.
    * Tweaking kernel parameters, so that it is possible to open 40000 TCP Consumer connections
      ("C10K" problem, look i.e. [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/410616/increasing-the-maximum-number-of-tcp-ip-connections-in-linux).
    * Changing RabbitMQ host in AuthProxy and Producer to point to VirtualBox.
    
## Test 1: Durable queue, but transient messages

Average results:         
- Client connections established in 12 secs
- Used ~7.7 GB of RAM
- Throughput: 5000 msgs/sec
    
![Transient - Screen](/doc/test_transient_3.png) 

## Test 2: Durable queue, persistent messages
         
Average results:
- Client connections established in 20 secs
- Used ~8.1 GB of RAM
- Throughput: 3500 msgs/sec
    
![Persistent - Screen](/doc/test_persistent_3.png) 

## Conclusions

In all cases:
* All messages were correctly delivered to all clients.
* Bottleneck seems to be in RabbitMQ CPU.
* Due to other tests, with multiple instances for each consumer (also with CC: field set by Producer)
  I noticed that the more recipients message has, the higher memory consumption is,
  sometimes it was doubled (don'r know why - message cached longer collecting ACKs?). 

# Potential extensions

* Use wss:// (instead of ws://) between Consumer and AuthProxy
* Extend protocol between Consumer and AuthProxy by introducing ACKs (that can be kept in sync with ACKs sent from
  AuthProxy to RabbitMQ).
* Rewrite AuthProxy in Java (i.e. with [Vertex](http://vertx.io/)? ;-) )
* ...
